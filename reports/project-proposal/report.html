            <h2>Perfectly Timed</h2>
            <p>Our image fits this years theme perfectly:</p>
            <p>First of all, it shows a perfectly timed moment, the cork just escaped, some champagne is splattering.
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, our image shows a celebration scene, something which is done after a great success, a win.</p>

            <h2>Our main reference image</h2>
            <div class="twentytwenty-container">
                <img src="images/ref1.jpg" alt="Champagner" class="img-responsive">
            </div> <br>
            <h2>A secondary reference image</h2>
            <div class="twentytwenty-container">
                <img src="images/candles-ref.jpg" alt="Candles" class="img-responsive">
            </div> <br>

            <p>We like to extend the primary image with these aspects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a foreground with champagne-glasses and other celebration decorations on a table</li>
                <li>Add a background as an environment map from HDRI Haven</li>
                <li>Add some form of emissive participating media, maybe small candles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our features</h2>
            <h3>Roger Barton (17-948-324)</h3>
            <h4>Blender (5)</h4>
                <p>We'd like to use Blender to model the fluid splashing out of the bottle with a blender fluid simulation. 
                    This will be exported as a normal triangle mesh.
                    The smoke will be done using the OpenVDB format, which blender can produce for us.
                </p>
            <h4>Depth of Field (5)</h4>
                <p>This can be verified by comparing to an identical render with blender cycles. The camera properties can be set to be the 
                    same except that a conversion to f-stops will be done, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number#Notation">wikipedia</a>.
                </p>
            <h4>Bump Mapping or Normal Mapping (5)</h4>
                <p>
                    We can validate this with an adapted normal integrator from the first assignment.
                    To ensure that the directions are correct a comparison render can be made with blender cycles.
                </p>
            <h4>Anisotropic Phase Function (e.g. Henyey-Greenstein) (5)</h4>
                <p>This will be validated by comparing to another renderer, for example the cycles renderer.
                    The phase function can also be visualized in the warptest to see that it visually corresponds to the images in the lecture slides and pbr book.
                    The blender principled volume shader has an anisotropy value in the range [-1,1], which appears to correspond to the asymmetry parameter g in henyey-greenstein (this will need to be checked).
                </p>
            <h4>Emissive Participating Media (10)</h4>
                <p>
                    The blender principled volume shader also has an emission value. Potentially this can also be used to compare renders for a homogeneous volume. 
                    Although there will likely need to be some unit conversion.
                </p>
            <h4>Heterogenous Participating Media (30)</h4>
                <p>
                    To validate, we can render a homogeneous volume with the heterogeneous integrator and check that they are the same.
                    We can also compare a render to blender cycles. 
                    There will be some differences probably due to blender having a more advanced material or different interpolation (although this can be specified). 
                    But it can still serve as a reference.
                </p>

            <h3>Matthias Busenhart (17-918-160)</h3>
            <h4>Images as Textures (5)</h4>
                <p>This can be visually verified with an albedo texture. Images should be mappable to objects using the uv coordinates.</p>
            <h4>Simple Extra Emitters (5)</h4>
                <p>I plan to add the following emitter: spotlight</p>
                <p>Validation is done by rendering images as already seen in project 3.</p>
            <h4>Simple Denoising (10)</h4>
                <p>Denoising Variation is done by a comparison (side by side) of a denoised image an the original image.
                    The denoiser can also be compared to another denoiser.
                </p>
            <h4>Adaptive Sampling (10)</h4>
                <p>Validation is done by visual inspection. The rendered image should look correct and in addition a
                    variance plot can be shown. We will produce an image which shows the normalized number of samples per pixel. 
                    We can then verify that regions with high variance have more samples, 
                    e.g. regions with caustics.
                </p>
            <h4>Disney BSDF (15)</h4>
                <p>Validation is done by comparing our implementation with the image found on <a
                        href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2015-shading-course/burley/s2015_pbs_disney_bsdf_slides.pdf">this</a>
                    presentation (slide 3).</p>
            <h4>Environment Map Emitter (15)</h4>
                <p>This feature is easy to verify, since it is clear by a glance if the environment map works. Possibly the
                    same scene from different angles will be done in order to show that for example an image as an environment
                    will turn with the scene. The emitter sampling will be verified by comparing different integrators and the resuling image. (direct ems, direct mats, direct mis)
                </p>

            <h3>Comments on some Features</h3>
                <p>We like to add a smoke, which comes out from the bottle (which appears if you open a bottle under
                    pressure).</p>
                <p>The candle wax will be melted and modeled as coloured glass (dielectric) to avoid a BSSDF.</p>

                <p>For validation, if it turns out that blender does not allow for a good enough comparison we will fallback to the pbrt or mitsuba renderers.</p>

            <h3>Misc Features</h3>
                <p>We have already added more gui features with the Dear GUI library. 
                    So we can interactively tune the scene parameters and see how the 
                    render changes. This will allow for faster validation of certain features, as we can easily try out 
                    multiple parameters in a short amount of time.
                </p>
